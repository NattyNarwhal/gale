This directory contains public header files for those foreign components for
which liboop includes "adapters".  By including them here, we can build the
adapters without requiring the presence of the foreign components in question.

An adapter will still not function without the code it adapts, of course, but
at least this way we eliminate pesky build ordering issues.

Many of these have specific licensing terms and agreements:

adns.h

        statement applies to all versions of adns.h I have released so far,
        and to any files adns.h with similar contents and function I might
        release during the remainder of this calendar year (1999).
