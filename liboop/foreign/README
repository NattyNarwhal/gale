This directory contains public header files for those foreign components for
which liboop includes "adapters".  By including them here, we can build the
adapters without requiring the presence of the foreign components in question.

An adapter will still not function without the code it adapts, of course, but
at least this way we eliminate pesky build ordering issues.

Many of these are licensed under specific agreements:

adns.h

    adns is Ian Jackson's asynchronous DNS access package.

    While adns is licensed under the GPL, Ian has graciously consented to the
    distribution of its public header file (adns.h) under the LGPL:

        I hereby relicence adns.h - and only adns.h - to you (and all third
        parties) under the GNU Library General Public Licence.  This
        statement applies to all versions of adns.h I have released so far,
        and to any files adns.h with similar contents and function I might
        release during the remainder of this calendar year (1999).
