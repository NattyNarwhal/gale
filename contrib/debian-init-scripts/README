debian-init-scripts
-------------------

These files contain scripts intended to allow a debian system to start
and stop the gale daemons (galed and gdomain) on boot and shutdown.
Also included is a script to install the scripts using debian tools.

You can install the scripts by running "./install-script install" as
root.  This will install the init script in /etc/init.d, register it
with the system, and place the defaults file in /etc/default.  You can
modify /etc/default/gale to configure which daemons get started and
under which user id.

If you installed to a non-default PREFIX (ie. not /usr/local) then you
will need to edit the init script (gale_init_script or
/etc/init.d/gale after installation) to change the PREFIX variable.
