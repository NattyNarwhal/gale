default gsubrc highlights, filters out unprintable characters
category expressions in the log server should work now
SIGUSR1 to restart gsub, server
the server is now "galed" instead of "server"
client now sets SO_KEEPALIVE; should fail better in the face of net problems
programs all ignore SIGPIPE; this should help prevent undue server death

nonzero gsubrc return -> receipt?
server: turn -l into GALE_...
timestamps: when sent, not when started
fix .gale/conf line-length error
anchors
add error messages to gsubrc protocol
negative categories in sent messages
signing with other keys
key distribution; new crypto layer, file formats
add flag to gsub to add to the defaults

make gwrite wrapper to gsend
clean up include files
error reporting in glcgi
command-line interface to logs (log server)
summary log view in CGI, links, URL detection, menus, other spiffiness
$var expansion in gale.conf
